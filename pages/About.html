                <p>I was very confident. Yes “was”, now I always tend to doubt myself so much. Even if there’s no reason to. It all happened in school. Even though that place holds so much value to me I also have a few things I necessarily did not like about over there. No one is born with low self confidence or an inferiority complex. It is built over the years due to our surroundings and the effect it has on our untouched minds. In India, maybe not everywhere but I’m just talking about my place, the colour of your skin holds quite an importance. It makes others presume things about us that are unlikely to be true. Appearance is something we should notice in a person but not judge the person on it’s basis. We should accept the differences as they are because in the end we are all humans and we are the same. The blood in our veins is the same.</p>
